# NPWeather


Full stack application written in Java utilizing the Spring MVC framework running on Tomcat Server. 
The view was written in JSTL and EL, the model was integrated with PostgreSQL, and the controller 
handled the GET and POST requests between the client and server. Using session users were able to change
temperature forecasts to Celsius, and back to Fahrenheit as they wished. 

Finally, the user has the option to complete a survey that utilizes server side validation to verify input before
returning a summary of all survey results to the user. As our first full web application that we built from the beginning,
the project was a great learning experience that required understanding of how to integrate multiple technologies to create
a positive user experience while also gathering business data from customers.
